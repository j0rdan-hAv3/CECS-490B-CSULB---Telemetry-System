# CECS-490B-CSULB---Telemetry-System
This collaborative senior project is built on the STM32 Nucleo F446RE Development Board and uses the BMP388 and MPU6050 sensors to measure and collect telemetry data. It is done by me (Jordan Havelaar), James Henry, Cesar Hernandez, and Matthew Kim.

The sensors in this project collect the following data:
  -MPU6050:
    1. External Temperature (Celsius)
    2. Angle (x-axis, y-axis, z-axis)
    3. Acceleration (x-axis, y-axis, z-axis)
  -BMP388
    1. Internal Temperature (Celsius)
    2. Pressure
    3. Altitude
